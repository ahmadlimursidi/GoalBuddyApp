Okay, today I will be interviewing Coach Tah Taimizi. Hello. 
Speaker 2
Okay, please introduce yourself. Hi, my name is Coach Tah. I'm working as a coach for Little Kickers. and that's it 
Speaker 1
all right so coach ta just tested the app so i want to ask coach ta some questions what was the easiest part of using the 
Speaker 2
app the easiest part is the looking for the drill sessions very very very easy very specific place to see 
Speaker 1
What was the hardest or most confusing 
Speaker 2
part? The most confusing part is the finish flag over the top because it's a bit confusing because it's just a random flag. 
Speaker 1
What feature would you use most often? I would use the timer feature. Okay. What's 
Speaker 2
missing that you expected to see? I don't think there's anything missing. I think everything is okay. 
Speaker 1
Alright. Okay. So, I'm going to go through more specific, coach-specific questions. Would you actually use the active session timer during a real class with kids running around? Why or why not? Yes, 
Speaker 2
I would use it because while I'm looking at the lesson plan, I can simultaneously looking at the timer so that I don't overrun the class or end the class a bit early, 
Speaker 1
end the 
Speaker 2
session a bit 
Speaker 1
early. Do you usually have your phone with you during sessions? Yes, I do. Tell me about the drill animations. Were they helpful or distracting? 
Speaker 2
The drill animation is actually very very good. I'm actually amazed when I first saw the animation. It looks very very nice and I think it helps me to imagine running the drill a bit better. 
Speaker 1
uh does it is it the same as the pdf session drinks 
Speaker 2
uh no this is the app that i'm currently testing is way way better all 
Speaker 1
right uh how was the attendance marking experience 
Speaker 2
uh it was actually pretty good much better than the ones i'm currently using right now 
Speaker 1
yeah okay is there anything else you wanted to mention that i didn't cover 
Speaker 2
uh no i think everything everything has been asked everything has been covered i think the app is very good so kudos to Adli for creating this app i think it's gonna help a lot of people for their training session in the future. 
Speaker 1
Yeah, 
Speaker 2
that's all. 
Speaker 1
