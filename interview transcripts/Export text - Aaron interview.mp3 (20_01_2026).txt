Good morning. Today I will be interviewing one of the parents of the children in Little Pickers. Can you introduce yourself? 
Speaker 1
Yeah, my name is Aaron Craig. I'm a parent of Sammy Craig at Little Pickers Portagia. 
Speaker 2
Right. After Mr. Aaron just recently did a user testing, so I would like to ask you a big question. 
Speaker 1
What was the easiest part of using the app? Just the fact that everything's in one place and the navigation through the buttons and the different pages are easy to use. 
Speaker 2
Do you think there's a hard part? Is there a big learning curve of using the dashboard? 
Speaker 1
No, I think it was very straightforward and simple for parents to access quite quickly their child's progress, being able to pay fees and the attendance of their child on the campus. 
Speaker 2
Alright, would you check this app 
Speaker 1
regularly? What would motivate you to open it? I would use it daily, just to obviously check my child's progress and what skills they need to develop for the next coming week, but also use it monthly to pay fees. How do you currently stay informed about your child's class and progress? So child's progress is very difficult at the moment because there's no app in place. You're just relying on the WhatsApp group that I'm in and that's usually how I pay fees. But for child's progress, I'm not quite sure at what level he's at. What additional information about your child's training would you like to see? Coaches notes or specific skills? I think more of like a development so skills that they need to work towards in the coming weeks or coming months and just so we can practice at home also. 
Speaker 2
All right. The app shows class time, venue and coach. Is that enough information? 
Speaker 1
Yeah, I think it's suitable for the children of this age to know just, you know, what class they need to attend and what day. I don't think it needs to be any more details or then it gets more complicated. I see. 
Speaker 2
All right. Is there anything else you want to mention? 
Speaker 1
No, I just think after navigating through the app as a demo, I thought it was a very niche thing to include in Little Kickers, and I think it would be beneficial to parents, coaches, and admin. 
Speaker 2
Okay, thank you so much for your time, Mr. 
Speaker 1
Craig. No problem, thank you for your time.
